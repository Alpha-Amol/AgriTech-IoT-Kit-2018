# AgriTech-IoT-Kit-2018
It's an Internet of Connected Kit for educational purpose based on Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266). It has bunch of sensors to detect sunlight, soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature and humidity. These are the most critical 'vitals' that indicate a plant's well being - does it have enough sunlight, water? It will send you these values on your mobile app and based on that you can take appropriate actions. Using these specialized sensors, it automatically waters and monitors your plants in real time.

<br/>
Having green spaces in our homes the key to maintaining a happy and healthy lifestyle. But our pace of life gives us little chance to keep the exact rhythm of watering the plants according to their needs. With how busy our lives are, it's sometimes easy to forget to pay a little attention to your thirsty indoor plants until it's too late and you are left with a crusty pile of yellow carcasses. 
<br/>
The main reasons for dying plants are over- and under-watering, temperature and light issues. That’s probably happening because plants can’t talk and express directly what they need. They may need very careful and accurate watering. Some of them need more light and some need less. Air temperature and humidity are also highly important.
<br/>
You never have to worry about dead plants again. This kit will make your regular plant pot a smart automated pot which will take care of watering your plants and provide artificial light using LED Light. 

## Goals for the Kit:-
•	Monitor plant vitals in real time (Soil Moisture, Soil Temperature, Air Temperature and Humidity, Light Intensity and Wi-Fi Signal Strength too). <br/>
•	Automatically water your plants. <br/>
•	Switch ON the grow light when needed.  <br/>
•	App based control on watering and LED grow light. For example, when you press the 'water' button on your app, it sends the signal to the wemos, which actuates a water pump.  <br/>
